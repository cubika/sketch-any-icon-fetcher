# Sketch GetFavicon plugin
Sketch plugin to import any favicon into your design by entering the website's URL. 
The plugin was originally made for our use in the Product Design team at [Similarweb](http://similarweb.com "Similarweb"), and hopefully some of you out there will also find it useful :)  
The plugin uses the Google Favicon API.
