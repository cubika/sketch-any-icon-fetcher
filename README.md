# Sketch GetFavicon plugin
![image to explain how this works](https://github.com/sagishrieber/sketch-get-favicon-by-url/raw/master/favicon-plugin-demo.gif "how this works")

## So..
Yep! It's a Sketch plugin to import any favicon into your design by entering the website's URL. 

The plugin was originally made for our use in the Product Design team at [Similarweb](http://similarweb.com "Similarweb"), and hopefully some of you out there will also find it useful :)  

The plugin uses the Google Favicon API.
